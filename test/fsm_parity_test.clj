  "Parity gate binding the generic engine to the Kotoba player profile.

   ## What this gate means now, which is not what it meant when it landed

   It landed as the only thing connecting two implementations of one machine.
   That is no longer what `default-player-fsm` is: `kami.fsm/advance` DELEGATES
   that machine to the shipped `resources/kami/fsm/oracle/player.kir.edn`, so
   pointing this gate at it would compare a fresh compile of `fsm.kotoba`
   against the artifact compiled from `fsm.kotoba` — a real check, but the one
   `kami.fsm-oracle-test/the-shipped-artifact-is-the-current-source-compiled`
   already makes directly, and not a check on the generic engine at all.

   So the oracle here is `generic-oracle` below: the same transition table
   under a map `advance` cannot recognise as the profile's machine, which is
   what keeps a GENERIC-engine answer on the other side of every comparison.
   With that, this file still says exactly what it always said — the Kotoba
   profile and the map-driven engine agree over the whole declared domain — and
   the two checks it structurally cannot make (that the shipped artifact is the
   current source, and that the host actually runs it) live next door in
   `kami.fsm-oracle-test`.

   This package states one state machine twice:

     * `src/kami/fsm.cljc` (+ the `src/kotoba/fsm.cljc` facade) — the generic
       map-driven EDN engine, reached here through `generic-oracle`. It is
       still what answers every machine that is not `default-player-fsm`, every
       state the profile does not declare, and every event collection it cannot
       express, so it is still an implementation and it is the ORACLE here.
     * `src/kami/fsm.kotoba` (+ the `src/kotoba/fsm.kotoba` facade) — the closed
       `:kami.fsm/player-v1` profile, with different names and a different
       encoding (a `[:variant …]` per state instead of a keyword, a
       `[:set :keyword]` instead of a Clojure set).

   Until this file existed, nothing connected them. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   compiles `test/kotoba/fsm_conformance.kotoba` and checks its `main` returns
   42 — that proves the Kotoba graph links and executes, and it hard-codes five
   hand-picked transitions inside the Kotoba side itself, so it can never
   observe the `.cljc` at all. `fsm_test.clj` tests only the `.cljc`. Either
   side could drift and the build would stay green.

   The gate closes that: it compiles the `.kotoba` in-process and runs it
   against the `.cljc` over the WHOLE closed domain — every state crossed with
   every subset of the declared event alphabet — plus events outside the
   alphabet and two-step sequences.

   Correspondence established (measured, not assumed — see the shape comments
   below):

     | Kotoba export       | `.cljc`                                   |
     |---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
     | `idle-state`        | the state keyword `:idle`, and            |
     |                     | `(initial default-player-fsm)`            |
     | `move-state`        | the state keyword `:move`                 |
     | `jump-state`        | the state keyword `:jump`                 |
     | `advance-player-v1` | `(advance generic-oracle state events)`    |
     |   arg `state`       | the `state` argument                      |
     |   arg `events`      | the `events` set                          |
     |   result            | the returned state keyword                |

   `params` has NO Kotoba counterpart: every variant case carries an `:i64`
   payload that the profile always sets to 0, so the Kotoba side models
   transitions only, not the per-state visual params. `params-is-unbound`
   below pins that as a tripwire rather than leaving it implicit."

   Same `:transitions`, so the semantics are identical and this gate compares

   map equality with `default-player-fsm` — is false. Without this the oracle

   That the marker really does turn delegation off is not left to this comment:
