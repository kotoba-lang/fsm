  Runs under :test because the compiler lives there and must not reach the
  library. What it writes IS what a consumer loads, so nothing here transforms
  it: same compile call as the drift test, pretty-printed EDN, no
  post-processing. If this file and that test disagreed about how to compile,
  the test would be checking something other than what ships."

  `:js-kotoba-v1` is what the compiler requires for entryless libraries and for
  typed values, which is what this module is, and it is already the target
  `fsm-parity-test` compiles under. KIR is target-independent for this core —
  it carries no effects and `test/kotoba/fsm_conformance.kotoba` links and runs
  the same graph on the wasm target — but ONE of them has to be the artifact,
  and naming it here rather than in two places is what keeps regeneration
  reproducible."
