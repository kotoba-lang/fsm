  "What keeps the shipped artifact honest, now that it is what runs.

  `fsm-parity-test` compiles `src/kami/fsm.kotoba` fresh and compares it to
  `kami.fsm/advance` over `default-player-fsm`. That was the whole check while
  the host had its own copy of the transition table. It is not the whole check
  any more, because for that machine the host no longer computes it — it reads
  `resources/kami/fsm/oracle/player.kir.edn`, and a fresh compile is not that
  file. Two things have to hold that did not have to before:

    1. the shipped artifact IS the current source, compiled
    2. the host actually reads it, rather than having quietly kept a copy

  The second is the one that is easy to lose and impossible to see: a
  delegation that fell back to a host implementation would pass every parity
  test ever written, because a host copy is exactly what those tests compare
  against. So this asks the only question that separates them — swap in a core
  that answers differently and see whether the host follows.

  It asks the mirror question too. `kami.fsm` is a GENERIC engine and the
  profile is a bounded slice of it, so most of this namespace's public surface
  must NOT follow the substituted core. `the-generic-engine-does-not-reach-the-guest`
  states that in the direction that can fail: under a core that gets every
  profile answer wrong, a call outside the profile is expected to be
  UNCHANGED."
