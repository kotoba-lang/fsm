(ns kami.fsm-oracle
  "Runs the shipped decision core.

  `src/kami/fsm.kotoba` holds the player profile's transition rule;
  `resources/kami/fsm/oracle/player.kir.edn` is what was compiled from it and
  what ships. This namespace is the seam, and it is deliberately thin: it
  resolves a resource, executes an export, and decides nothing.

  ## Why this exists

  The profile landed with `fsm-parity-test`, which compiled the `.kotoba` and
  required it to answer as `kami.fsm/advance` over `default-player-fsm` did.
  That was the right first step and it is still here. But two implementations
  bound by a test are still two implementations, and the measure of the port is
  not how many host lines went away; it is whether the AUTHORITY moved. Until
  now it had not: the `.kotoba` was a checked replica and the `.cljc` was what
  ran. Now the `.kotoba` is what runs for the calls it can express, and the
  `.cljc` keeps the generic engine, which the profile deliberately does not
  cover.

  ## The guest ABI, and the two places the host has to meet it

  Both boundary shapes below were MEASURED against the pinned interpreter, not
  guessed:

    * a variant crosses as `[schema case-tag payload]` — `idle-state` returns
      `[[:variant :kami.fsm/player-state-v1
         [[:idle :i64] [:move :i64] [:jump :i64]]] :idle 0]`.
      A bare `:idle` is refused with \"value is not the declared variant type\",
      and a case the schema does not declare with \"variant case is not
      declared\".
    * a `[:set :keyword]` crosses as `[type items-vector]` — NOT a Clojure set,
      which is refused with \"value is not the declared typed set\". The
      interpreter sorts the items itself, rejects a duplicate (\"typed set
      contains a duplicate item\") and rejects a non-keyword item (\"value is
      not a keyword\").

  Neither schema is written down in this namespace or in `kami.fsm`: they are
  read back out of the shipped artifact, which IS the `.kotoba` compiled, so a
  host builds its arguments from the source of the rule rather than from a copy
  of it.

  ## No fallback around a missing artifact

  A missing or unreadable artifact throws. It does not quietly run something
  else, because a silent fallback is how a decision stops being the one that
  shipped. Which path `kami.fsm/advance` takes is decided by the VALUES it was
  handed, never by whether this namespace could load anything.

  ## ClojureScript hosts must register the KIR

  There is no classpath to read a resource from, so `register-kir!` is the only
  way in and `kir` throws without it. That is a real narrowing of what this
  library used to do on that runtime and it is stated rather than discovered:
  see the boundary note on `kami.fsm`."
